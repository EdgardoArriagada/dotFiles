Whenever working with any third-party library or something similar, you MUST look up the official documentation to ensure that you're working with up-to-date information.
Use the DocsExplorer subagent for efficient documentation lookup.


## Plan Mode

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
